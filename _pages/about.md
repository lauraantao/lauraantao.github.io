I am a global change ecologist. My main research interests are biodiversity, macroecology and global change.


I am particularly interested in how we can synthesize complex patterns across taxa, habitats and scales. In my research, I investigate how different drivers affect multiple biodiversity dimensions, from species to communities and entire biomes. I combine data science, modeling and synthetic approaches to examine patterns of biodiversity change over space and time using long-term data, and link these patterns to large scale environmental drivers, such as climate and land use. 


I am an Academy Research Fellow at the [Organismal & Evolutionary Biology Research Programme](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-biological-and-environmental-sciences/research/organismal-and-evolutionary-biology) at the [University of Helsinki](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/laura-ant%C3%A3o).

Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Research Centre for Ecological Change](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/research-centre-for-ecological-change). I did my PhD at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, where I investigated the effects of scale on different biodiversity patterns. I completed my undergraduate and Master studies at the University of Lisbon, Portugal, both focusing on Marine Ecology.
