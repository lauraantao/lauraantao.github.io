I am a global change ecologist. My main research interests are biodiversity, macroecology and global change. 

I am particularly interested in how we can synthesize complex patterns across taxa, habitats and scales. In my research, I investigate how different drivers affect multiple biodiversity dimensions, from species to communities and entire biomes. I combine data science, modeling and synthetic approaches to examine patterns of biodiversity change over space and time using long-term data, and link these patterns to large scale environmental drivers, such as climate and land-use. 


I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [**Research Centre for Ecological Change**](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/research-centre-for-ecological-change), University of Helsinki.

Before that, I completed my undergraduate and Masterâ€™s at the University of Lisbon, Portugal, both focusing on Marine Ecology. Then I did my PhD at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, where I investigated the effects of scale on different biodiversity patterns.
