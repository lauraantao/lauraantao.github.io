I am a global change ecologist. My main research interests are biodiversity, macroecology and global change. I am particularly interested in biodiversity synthesis and biodiversity patterns, and how we can generalize information across taxa and habitats, and furthermore across scales. In my research, I examine patterns of biodiversity change over space and time using long-term data, and link these patterns to large scale environmental drivers, such as climate and land-use.

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Research Centre for Ecological Change, University of Helsinki. Before that, I completed my undergraduate and Masterâ€™s at the University of Lisbon, Portugal, both focusing on Marine Ecology. Then I did my PhD at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, where I investigated the effects of scale on different biodiversity patterns.
