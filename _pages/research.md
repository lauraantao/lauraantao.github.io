# **Predicting biodiversity change in the Anthropocene – species and community-level responses to climate change**
Climate change is causing rapid changes in biodiversity around the world. In order to inform conservation and policy actions, we need to understand how and why
biodiversity is changing. This is a complex issue, because species have different characteristics and can respond differently – i.e. some species are winners and others
are losers, and because species together form complex communities. This project will use information on species abundance records that have been collected for several
decades for birds and moths across Finland. It will use statistical methods to evaluate how fast changes in precipitation and temperature are affecting species
individual responses, and then how those changes combined affect entire communities. This will allow us to understand which species are most vulnerable to climate
change, which is fundamental to understand the complex changes in biodiversity that are occurring, and to help make predictions for the future.



# **Biodiversity change across space and time**
Within this topic, I aim to assess the effect of recent climate change on local patterns in community structure across the globe, using global synthesis of 
long-term observations. I also assess how different biodiversity aspects have changed using long-term data collected along a latitudinal gradient in Finland.
