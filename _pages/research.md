## **Quantifying and predicting biodiversity change in the Anthropocene**

Biodiversity is being rapidly restructured around the world. In order to inform conservation and policy, we need to understand how, why and where biodiversity is changing. This is a complex issue, because species have different traits and can respond differently â€“ i.e. some species are winners and others
are losers, and because species form complex communities.
I use long-term abundance records collected for several decades for different taxa to evaluate how and where e.g. birds and moths respond to climate change across large spatial scales. Then I aim to understand how these species individual responses combine to affect the structure and composition of entire communities.


On the other hand, biodiversity is itself multidimensional. I aim to assess the effects of global change on patterns of community structure using global synthesis of 
long-term observations and quantifying change across multiple biodiversity dimensions, and specifically across large-scale spatial and latitudinal gradients.

These lines of research will allow us to understand which species and communities are most vulnerable to global change - and where, which is fundamental to quantify the complex patterns of ongoing biodiversity change, and to enable us to build more accurate predictions under future scenarios of change.
