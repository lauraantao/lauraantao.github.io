## **Quantifying and predicting biodiversity change in the Anthropocene**

Biodiversity is being rapidly restructured around the world. In order to inform conservation and policy, we need to understand *how*, *why* and *where* biodiversity is changing. This is a complex issue, because species have different traits and can respond differently â€“ i.e. some species are winners and others are losers, and because species form complex communities.

In my research, I mostly use long-term monitoring data and synthesis to evaluate how different species of different taxa respond to global change across large spatial scales - e.g. birds and moths responses to climate change. Then I aim to understand how these species individual responses combine to affect the structure and composition of entire communities.

On the other hand, biodiversity is itself multidimensional. Thus, I further aim to assess the effects of global change on patterns of community structure quantifying change across multiple biodiversity dimensions, and specifically across large-scale spatial and latitudinal gradients.

These lines of research allow us to understand which species and communities are most vulnerable to global change, which is fundamental to quantify the complex patterns of ongoing biodiversity change, and to build more accurate predictions under future scenarios of change.
